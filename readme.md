# Ant Colony Optimization for Graph Traversal

## Overview

This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the graph traversal problem. The ants navigate through a graph to find an optimal path based on pheromone levels and heuristics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/liamLatour/Pro-Tech.git
    cd Pro-Tech
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in a browser after installation.
2. Adjust the parameters using the provided form.
3. Click on the "Générer" button to generate a new graph and start the optimization process.

## Configuration

- **Number of Nodes (`nb_node`):** Adjust the number of nodes in the graph.
- **Number of Ants (`nb_ants`):** Set the number of ants participating in the optimization.
- **Heuristic/Pheromone Importance (`importance`):** Adjust the balance between heuristic and pheromone information.
- **Evaporation Rate (`evaporation`):** Set the rate at which pheromones evaporate.
- **Added Pheromone (`adding`):** Adjust the amount of pheromone added by ants.
